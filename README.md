### 1. Exercise: Console and console.log()
**Task:** Use `console.log()` to print your name, your age, and a welcome message.

---

### 2. Exercise: Variables
**Task:** Declare variables for your name, age, and whether you are a student. Print each variable.

---

### 3. Exercise: Data Types: Number
**Task:** Create variables for height (in cm), weight (in kg), and age. Log them to the console.

---

### 4. Exercise: Data Types: String
**Task:** Store your first and last name in string variables. Combine them into a full name and print it.

---

### 5. Exercise: Math Operators
**Task:** Use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` with two numbers. Log each result.

---

### 6. Exercise: Operator Precedence (BIDMAS)
**Task:** Evaluate the expression `10 + 2 * 5 - (3 + 1)`. Log the result and explain why.

---

### 7. Exercise: Shorthand Operators
**Task:** Start with `let score = 10`. Use `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` to update `score` and log the results.

---

### 8. Exercise: NaN
**Task:** Divide a number by a string (e.g., `10 / "abc"`). Log the result and check if it's `NaN`.

---

### 9. Exercise: String Interpolation (Backticks)
**Task:** Use template literals to log: `Hello, my name is NAME and I am AGE years old.` Use variables.

---

### 10. Exercise: Undefined
**Task:** Declare a variable without assigning a value. Log it to the console.

---

### 11. Exercise: Null
**Task:** Declare a variable and assign `null` to it. Log its value and type.

---

### 12. Exercise: Arrays
**Task:** Create an array of 5 favorite fruits. Print the third item and change the last item.

---

### 13. Exercise: Boolean Data Type
**Task:** Create a variable `isOnline` set to `true`. Toggle its value and print each state.

---

### 14. Exercise: Control Flow (Loops)
**Task:** Use a `for` loop to print numbers 1 through 10. Then use a `while` loop to print even numbers 2–20.

---

### 15. Exercise: Conditional Statements
**Task:** Write a program that checks age and prints "child", "teenager", or "adult".

---

### 16. Exercise: Logical Operators
**Task:** Create variables `isLoggedIn` and `isAdmin`. Use logical operators to determine access.

---

### 17. Exercise: Practice Exercise: Student Grading System
**Task:** Write a program that takes a score (0–100) and outputs a grade (A–F).

---

### 18. Exercise: Break and Continue (in for loop with if clause)
**Task:** Print numbers 1–10. Skip 5 using `continue` and stop at 8 using `break`.

---

### 19. Exercise: Switch Statement
**Task:** Use a switch statement to print whether a given day is a weekday or weekend.

---

### 20. Exercise: Variable and Block Scope
**Task:** Declare a variable inside and outside a block. Print both and explain the result.

---

### 21. Exercise: Functions: Declaration, Expression, Arguments, and Parameters
**Task:** Create a function `greet(name)` using both function declaration and expression. Log the result when called.
